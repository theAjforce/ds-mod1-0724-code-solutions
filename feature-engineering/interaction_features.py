    Creates interaction features by multiplying pairs of features in the DataFrame.

    Args:
        df (pd.DataFrame): The input DataFrame containing the features.
        feature_pairs (list[tuple[str, str]]): List of tuples specifying pairs of features to multiply.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The DataFrame with added interaction features.

    Examples:
        df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2], 'B': [3, 4]})
        feature_pairs = [('A', 'B')]
        create_interaction_features(df, feature_pairs)  # Output: DataFrame with 'A_x_B' column
